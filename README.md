This repository contains a simple COBOL program with a common error: missing data division.  The program attempts to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, but it fails to declare the variables used.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to define data in COBOL.  This example highlights the importance of explicit data definition in COBOL programs to prevent runtime errors and ensure data integrity.
